# The FUSE section handles settings on the FUSE file system. FUSE

  # This will produce a lot of logging. Not for general use.
  debug: false

# The data section specifies where internal LiteFS data is stored
# and how long to retain the transaction files.
# 
# Transaction files are used to ship changes to replica nodes so
# they should persist long enough for replicas to retrieve them,
# even in the face of a short network interruption or a redeploy.
# Under high load, these files can grow large so it's not advised
# to extend retention too long.

# The exec field specifies a command to run as a subprocess of
# LiteFS. This command will be executed after LiteFS either
# becomes primary or is connected to the primary node. LiteFS
# will forward signals to the subprocess and LiteFS will
# automatically shut itself down when the subprocess stops.
#
# This can also be specified after a double-dash (--) on the
# command line invocation of the 'litefs mount' command.

# This API server is how nodes communicate with each other.
http:
  # Specifies the bind address of the HTTP API server.

# The lease section defines how LiteFS creates a cluster and
# implements leader election. For dynamic clusters, use the
# "consul". This allows the primary to change automatically when
# the current primary goes down. For a simpler setup, use
# "static" which assigns a single node to be the primary and does
# not failover.
lease:
  # Required. Must be either "consul" or "static".

  # Sets the hostname that other nodes will use to reference this
  # node. Automatically assigned based on hostname(1) if not set.
  hostname: "myhost"

  # Specifies whether the node can become the primary. If using
  # "static" leasing, this should be set to true on the primary
  # and false on the replicas.
  candidate: true

  # A Consul server provides leader election and ensures that the
  # responsibility of the primary node can be moved in the event
  # of a deployment or a failure.
  consul:
    # Required. The base URL of the Consul server.

    key: "litefs/primary"

    # Length of time before a lease expires. The primary will
    # automatically renew the lease while it is alive, however,
    # if it fails to renew in time then a new primary may be
    # elected after the TTL. This only occurs for unexpected loss
    # of the leader as normal operation will allow the leader to
    # handoff the lease to another replica without downtime.
    #
    # Consul does not allow a TTL of less than 10 seconds.
    ttl: "10s"

    # Length of time after the lease expires before a candidate

    # overlap in leadership due to clock skew or in-flight calls.

# The tracing section enables a rolling, on-disk tracing log.
# This records every operation to the database so it can be
